# HTTP API for systemd

Hello my followers and lost in the internet guys, here's my new amazing project: HTTP API for systemd!
Yes! You will be able to interact with amazing systemd from http API, isn't that amazing?
But wait! There's more!!! It is written in Rust, not in JS/TS like 99% of my unfinished shit.

## Features
- (For now) Has exactly 1 (in words: one) endpoint: `/systemd/load-unit/{unit-name}`
- Uses unsafe Rust
- Is unsafe as hell
- Will require to run it with root priviliges <3
